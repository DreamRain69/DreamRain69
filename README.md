Hello! I am DreamRain69,yes,the 69 was on purpose,i am very funny.

I'm just a dude who wants to leave "LATINOAMERICA" (just like everyone frome there) and work as a programmer.
Creating websites,managing data bases,coding programs,i don't care,all of them sounds fun!

I'm just a begginer,i don't know how to do almost anything,but at least i know a little of python and i'm open to learn
any other programming Language.

I hope this doesn't end up in me giving up and crying in my bed(Like with almost anything)

And thank you for taking your time to see my profile,i hope you have a very good day,and an even better life.
